    example, an actor could be a user who posted a comment on a
    support case, a user who uploaded an attachment, or a service
    account that created a support case.

    Attributes:
        display_name (str):
            The name to display for the actor. If not
            provided, it is inferred from credentials
            supplied during case creation. When an email is
            provided, a display name must also be provided.
            This will be obfuscated if the user is a Google
            Support agent.
        email (str):
            The email address of the actor. If not provided, it is
            inferred from the credentials supplied during case creation.
            When a name is provided, an email must also be provided. If
            the user is a Google Support agent, this is obfuscated.

            This field is deprecated. Use **username** field instead.
        google_support (bool):
            Output only. Whether the actor is a Google
            support actor.
        username (str):
            Output only. The username of the actor. It
            may look like an email or other format provided
            by the identity provider. If not provided, it is
            inferred from the credentials supplied. When a
            name is provided, a username must also be
            provided. If the user is a Google Support agent,
            this will not be set.
